The intention was to kill him, and three men are accused of plotting to murder him. The shooting was heard throughout Woodford, and neighbors found Allen with a towel pressed to his neck and struggling to breathe. The gun used was a Glock 9mm, and DNA was matched to Kelly and Louis Ahearne on a nearby fence panel. Allen is a career criminal who was convicted of Britain's largest cash robbery in 2006. The defendants traveled from Woolwich, through the Blackwall Tunnel, to the victim's new home in Malvern Drive as part of the planning and execution of the conspiracy.",
